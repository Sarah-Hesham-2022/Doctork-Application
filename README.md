"Doctork Application" . The project idea is to detect X-rays images of chest and classify them into 3 classes (Covid-Pneumonia-Healthy), detect MRI of brain and classify them to (brain with tumor - brain with no tumor), detect MRI images of breast and classify them to (breast with cancer- breast with no cancer), we have built and trained deep learning models based on CNN and deployed these models to make a Graphical User Interface for our desktop application .
